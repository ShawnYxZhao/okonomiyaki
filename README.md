The name okonomiyaki originated from the famous Japanese pancake dish, which is made with flour and many different ingredients, such as cabbage, carrots, seafoods... The choice of ingredients can be very random.

I see my personal website very similar to okonomiyaki, because I want to share different things happened in my life on this very website. Such as my thinkings, learnings, travel experience and so on. The contents can be very random, just like ingredients used in okonomiyaki.
